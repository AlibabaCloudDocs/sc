# Reconfigure workspace resources

This topic describes how to scale in or out workspaces of fully managed Flink, namely how to reconfigure workspace resources.

**Note:** A workspace supports multiple projects. Therefore, you must scale in the projects before you scale in the workspace.

1.  Log on to the [Realtime Compute for Apache Flink console](https://realtime-compute.console.aliyun.com/regions/cn-shanghai).

2.  Click the **Fully Managed Flink** tab.

3.  In the **Actions** column of the desired workspace, choose **More** \> **Reconfigure Workspace Resources**.
