# Job O&M

This topic describes how to view the details and status of jobs, change the job status, and modify job configurations.

## View job details

1.  Log on to the [Realtime Compute for Apache Flink console](https://realtime-compute.console.aliyun.com/regions/cn-shanghai).

2.  On the **Fully Managed Flink** tab, click **Development Console** in the **Actions** column of the desired workspace.

3.  In the left-side navigation pane, click **Deployments**.

4.  Click the name of the desired deployment.

5.  On the job details page, view the following information:

    -   **Overview**: overview of job parameters

        ![Overview](https://static-aliyun-doc.oss-accelerate.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/en-US/8345434161/p111702.png)

        **Note:** You can click **Metrics** to view more metrics, including general metrics of Flink.

    -   **Metrics**: displays general metrics of Flink.

        ![Metrics](https://static-aliyun-doc.oss-accelerate.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/en-US/9345434161/p212777.png)

        The following table lists the metrics that are supported by fully managed Flink powered by Ververica Runtime \(VVR\) 2.1.3 and later.

        **Note:** The √ symbol indicates that metrics can be reported. The x symbol indicates that metrics cannot be reported.

    -   **Events**: events during job running.

        ![Events](https://static-aliyun-doc.oss-accelerate.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/en-US/9345434161/p134095.png)

        On the **Events** tab, the following information about events is displayed by default: **Time**, **Message**, and **Actions**. To be more specific, **Actions** include:

        -   **Copy Message**: Copy message content.
        -   **Job Details**: View the details about the events that are generated by the job, including the deployment information, Artifact configuration, Flink configuration, logging configuration, and logging level configuration.

            **Note:**

            -   In the upper-right corner of the **Overview** page, you can click **Flink UI** to go to the open source **Flink UI** of the running job.
            -   You can click **Metrics** to go to the **Metrics** interface of the Ververica Platform \(VVP\) of the running job. By default, the **Metrics** interface displays information about the **metrics** that are generated within 30 minutes after the event occurs.
        -   **Filter Events for this Job**: filters the events for this job.

## View the job status

1.  Log on to the [Realtime Compute for Apache Flink console](https://realtime-compute.console.aliyun.com/regions/cn-shanghai).

2.  On the **Fully Managed Flink** tab, click **Development Console** in the **Actions** column of the desired workspace.

3.  In the left-side navigation pane, click **Deployments**.

4.  Click the name of the desired deployment.

5.  On the **Overview** tab, view the status of the job.

    In the upper-left corner of the page, two types of the job status appear:

    -   **Expected status**

        |State|Description|
        |-----|-----------|
        |RUNNING|The job is started based on the job configurations.|
        |CANCELLED|A running job is terminated.|
        |SUSPENDED|A savepoint is created for the running job before the job is terminated.|

    -   **Current status**

        |State|Description|
        |-----|-----------|
        |RUNNING|The job is started based on the job configurations.|
        |CANCELLED|A running job is terminated.|
        |SUSPENDED|A savepoint is created for the running job before the job is terminated.|
        |FINISHED|The job is finished.|
        |TRANSITIONING|The job is in the phase of transitioning to the expected status.|
        |FAILED|The job status fails to be transitioned to the expected status, and manual processing is required.|
        |ClusterUnreachable|VVP fails to access Job Manager \(JM\) to obtain the job status.|

    **Note:** After you click **Start**, the expected status of the job immediately becomes **RUNNING**. The current status becomes **TRANSITIONING**. The startup progress of the job appears. The frontend development platform VVP ensures that Flink jobs are eventually in the expected status.

    Assume that the status of a Flink job is transitioning to the expected status but the eventual expected status of the job changes. The job status first reaches the initial expected status and then is transitioned to the eventual expected status.


## Change the job status

1.  Log on to the [Realtime Compute for Apache Flink console](https://realtime-compute.console.aliyun.com/regions/cn-shanghai).

2.  On the **Fully Managed Flink** tab, click **Development Console** in the **Actions** column of the desired workspace.

3.  In the left-side navigation pane, click **Deployments**.

4.  Click the name of the desired deployment.

5.  Click the **Overview** tab. The job details page appears.

6.  Click the following buttons as needed to change the job status.

    ![Job status](https://static-aliyun-doc.oss-accelerate.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/en-US/9345434161/p134339.png)

    The following table describes the meaning of each button.

    |Operation|Description|
    |---------|-----------|
    |Suspend|Suspend a job. This indicates that a savepoint is created for the running job before the job is terminated. To suspend a job, the following two conditions must be met:    -   The address of the savepoint is configured. If the address of the savepoint is not configured, a job is directly terminated when you suspend the job. This results in job status loss.
    -   The savepoint operation is successful. |
    |Cancel|Terminate a job.|
    |Diagnosis|The system provides you some simple guidance based on the collected instantaneous job information, such as a failover, and general job diagnostics rules.|
    |Savepoint|Create a savepoint at the current moment. **Note:** Configure the address of the savepoint first. Otherwise, the savepoint fails. |
    |Fork|Copy a job.**Note:**

    -   The job to be copied is in the **CANCELLED** state.
    -   The name of the job to be copied is in the following format: Fork of Original job name, such as **Fork of test2**. |
    |Configure|Modify the basic or advanced configurations of a job.|
    |Delete|Delete a job. Only the jobs whose current status is not **RUNNING** can be deleted.|


## Modify job configurations

The job configurations include all the configuration content in the phase of publishing a job.

1.  Log on to the [Realtime Compute for Apache Flink console](https://realtime-compute.console.aliyun.com/regions/cn-shanghai).

2.  On the **Fully Managed Flink** tab, click **Development Console** in the **Actions** column of the desired workspace.

3.  In the left-side navigation pane, click **Deployments**.

4.  Click the name of the desired deployment.

5.  Modify the job configurations.

    You can use one of the following methods to modify the job configurations:

    -   **Edit with Template**

        In the upper-right corner of the page, click **Configure** and modify the configurations.

        ![Modify job configurations](https://static-aliyun-doc.oss-accelerate.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/en-US/9345434161/p134099.png)

    -   **Edit with YAML**

        In the upper-right corner of the page, click **Configure**. Click the **Edit with YAML** tab and modify the configuration information.

        ![Modification with YAML](https://static-aliyun-doc.oss-accelerate.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/en-US/9345434161/p134100.png)

6.  Click **Save Changes**.
