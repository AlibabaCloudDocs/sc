# Built-in functions

This topic describes the built-in functions provided by Realtime Compute for Apache Flink for data conversion.

For more information about the built-in functions of Apache Flink V1.11, visit [System \(Built-in\) Functions](https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-release-1.11/dev/table/functions/systemFunctions.html).

**Note:** If the built-in functions that you need cannot be found, you can implement user-defined functions. For more information about user-defined functions, see [Overview](/intl.en-US/Fully managed Flink/Flink SQL Reference/UDXs/Overview.md).
