# Overview

Flink Serverless is a product built on Apache Flink that provides fully managed computing services in real time.

## Benefits

-   Fully managed

    Flink Serverless is fully managed, which allows you to focus on business development instead of having to worry about cluster O&M.

-   End-to-end

    Flink Serverless provides end-to-end services such as submitting jobs, managing jobs, collecting metrics, and monitoring and alerting to make job development and O&M more efficient.

-   Value-added
    -   The engine interface is fully compatible with the open source Flink version, and provides value-added features such as GeminiStateBackend \(the Blink next-generation development backend\) to improve job performance and stability.
    -   You can use the Auto-Pilot feature to tune jobs.
-   Cost-effective

    Flink Serverless can be billed based on the number of resource CUs that you consume. You can purchase the required number of CUs based on your business needs.
