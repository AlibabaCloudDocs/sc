# Overview

Fully managed Flink is built on Apache Flink that provides fully managed computing services in real time.

## Benefits

-   Fully managed

    Fully managed Flink allows you to focus on business development instead of having to worry about cluster O&M.

-   End-to-end

    Fully managed Flink provides end-to-end services such as submitting jobs, managing jobs, collecting metrics, and monitoring and alerting to make job development and O&M more efficient.

-   Value-added
    -   The engine interface is fully compatible with the open source Flink version, and provides value-added features such as GeminiStateBackend \(self-developed high-performance status storage engine\) to improve job performance and stability.
    -   You can use the Autopilot feature to tune jobs.
-   Cost-effective

    Fully managed Flink can be charged based on the number of compute units \(CUs\) that you consume. You can purchase the required number of CUs based on your business requirements.
