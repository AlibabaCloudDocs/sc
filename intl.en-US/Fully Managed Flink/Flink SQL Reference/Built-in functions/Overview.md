# Overview

This topic describes the built-in functions provided by Realtime Compute for Apache Flink to convert data.

-   Flink V1.11: For more information, see [System \(Built-in\) Functions](https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-release-1.11/dev/table/functions/systemFunctions.html).
-   Flink V1.12: For more information, see [System \(Built-in\) Functions](https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-release-1.12/dev/table/functions/systemFunctions.html).

**Note:**

-   Some built-in functions are added to Flink VVR 3.0.0 compared with Flink V1.12. For more information, see [Scalar functions]().
-   If the built-in functions that you need cannot be found, you can use user-defined functions. For more information about user-defined functions, see [Overview](/intl.en-US/Fully Managed Flink/Flink SQL Reference/UDXs/Overview.md).
