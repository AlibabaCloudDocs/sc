# Overview

The development console of fully managed Flink allows you to develop, publish, suspend, and stop Flink DataStream jobs.

**Note:**

-   If the upstream and downstream storage systems that Flink DataStream jobs access use a whitelist mechanism, you must configure whitelists. For more information, see [Configure a whitelist](/intl.en-US/Fully Managed Flink/Preparations/Configure a whitelist.md).
-   Flink DataStream jobs supported by Realtime Compute for Apache Flink are developed based on the open source Flink version. For more information, see [Open source Flink version](https://github.com/apache/flink/tree/blink).

Flink DataStream allows you to call the underlying API operations of fully managed Flink so that you can use fully managed Flink in a flexible manner.
