# Reconfigure workspace resources

This topic describes how to scale in or out the workspaces of fully managed Flink to reconfigure workspace resources.

**Note:** A workspace supports multiple projects. Therefore, you must scale in the projects before you scale in the workspace.

1.  Log on to the [Realtime Compute for Apache Flink console](https://realtime-compute.console.aliyun.com/regions/cn-shanghai).

2.  Click the **Fully Managed Flink** tab.

3.  Find the workspace that you want to manage, and choose **More** \> **Reconfigure Workspace Resources** in the **Actions** column.

5.  Read the terms of service, select **Terms of Service**, and then click **OK**. Then, complete the payment.

    After you complete the payment, you can view the new resource quota in the **Consumed/Purchased CUs** column that corresponds to the workspace.
