# Create an ApsaraDB for HBase result table

This topic describes how to create an ApsaraDB for HBase result table in Realtime Compute for Apache Flink.

**Note:**

-   This topic applies only to Realtime Compute for Apache Flink in exclusive mode.
-   Blink versions earlier than 3.3.0 support only HBase Standard Edition.
-   Blink 3.3.0 and later versions support both HBase Standard Edition and HBase Enhanced Edition.
-   Blink 3.5.0 and later versions support switchover between primary and secondary ApsaraDB for HBase databases for data writing.
-   ApsaraDB for HBase result tables in Realtime Compute for Apache Flink do not support self-managed open source HBase.

## DDL syntax

In Realtime Compute for Apache Flink, you can use ApsaraDB for HBase to store output data.

-   The following sample code demonstrates how to create an ApsaraDB for HBase result table of HBase Standard Edition:

    ```
    create table liuxd_user_behavior_test_front (
        row_key varchar,
        from_topic varchar,
        origin_data varchar,
        record_create_time varchar,
        primary key (row_key)
    ) with (
        type = 'cloudhbase',
        zkQuorum = '2',  
        columnFamily = '<yourColumnFamily>',
        tableName = '<yourTableName>',
        batchSize = '500'
    );
    ```

-   The following sample code demonstrates how to create an ApsaraDB for HBase result table of HBase Enhanced Edition:

    ```
    create table liuxd_user_behavior_test_front (
        row_key varchar,
        from_topic varchar,
        origin_data varchar,
        record_create_time varchar,
        primary key (row_key)
    ) with (
        type = 'cloudhbase',
        endPoint = '<host:port>', ---- The Java API URL that is used to access the Enhanced Edition of an ApsaraDB for HBase database.
        userName  = 'root', -- The username that is used to access an ApsaraDB for HBase database.
        password = 'root', -- The password that is used to access an ApsaraDB for HBase database.
        columnFamily = '<yourColumnFamily>',
        tableName = '<yourTableName>',
        batchSize = '500'
    );
    ```

-   The following sample code demonstrates how to create an ApsaraDB for HBase dimension table of HBase Enhanced Edition in Blink versions later than 3.5.0:

    ```
    create table liuxd_user_behavior_test_front (
        row_key varchar,
        from_topic varchar,
        origin_data varchar,
        record_create_time varchar,
        primary key (row_key)
    ) with (
        type = 'cloudhbase',
        zkQuorum = '<host:port>', ---- The Java API URL that is used to access the Enhanced Edition of an ApsaraDB for HBase database.
        userName  = 'root', -- The username that is used to access an ApsaraDB for HBase database.
        password = 'root', -- The password that is used to access an ApsaraDB for HBase database.
        columnFamily = '<yourColumnFamily>',
        tableName = '<yourTableName>',
        batchSize = '500'
    );
    ```

-   The following sample code demonstrates how to create an ApsaraDB for HBase dimension table in a Blink version later than 3.5.0 that supports switchover between primary and secondary ApsaraDB for HBase databases for data writing:

    ```
    create table liuxd_user_behavior_test_front (
        row_key varchar,
        from_topic varchar,
        origin_data varchar,
        record_create_time varchar,
        primary key (row_key)
    ) with (
        type = 'cloudhbase',
        zkQuorum = '<host:port>', ---- The URL that is used to access ApsaraDB for HBase databases in high availability (HA) mode.
    Â    haClusterID = 'ha-xxx', ---- The instance ID of ApsaraDB for HBase databases in HA mode.
        userName  = 'root', -- The username that is used to access an ApsaraDB for HBase database.
        password = 'root', -- The password that is used to access an ApsaraDB for HBase database.
        columnFamily = '<yourColumnFamily>',
        tableName = '<yourTableName>',
        batchSize = '500' 
    );
    ```


**Note:**

-   You can define multiple fields for the primary key. Multiple fields are separated by the value of `rowkeyDelimiter`. The default value is a colon \(`:`\).
-   If a column stores multiple versions of a value, all versions of the value are deleted when you perform an undo operation in the ApsaraDB for HBase database.
-   The connection parameters in HBase Standard Edition and HBase Enhanced Edition are different.
    -   HBase Standard Edition: `zkQuorum`
    -   HBase Enhanced Edition: `endPoint`

## Parameters in the WITH clause

|Parameter|Description|Required|Remarks|
|---------|-----------|--------|-------|
|zkQuorum|The ZooKeeper address configured for the ApsaraDB for HBase cluster.|Yes|You can view the configuration related to hbase.zookeeper.quorum in the hbase-site.xml file. **Note:** This parameter takes effect only in HBase Standard Edition. |
|zkNodeParent|The path of the cluster configured on the ZooKeeper servers.|No|You can view the configuration related to hbase.zookeeper.quorum in the hbase-site.xml file. **Note:** This parameter takes effect only in HBase Standard Edition. |
|endPoint|The name of the region where your ApsaraDB for HBase instance is deployed.|Yes|You can obtain the value of this parameter from the console of your ApsaraDB for HBase instance. **Note:** This parameter takes effect only in HBase Enhanced Edition. |
|userName|The username that is used to access an ApsaraDB for HBase database.|No|**Note:** This parameter takes effect only in HBase Enhanced Edition. |
|password|The password that is used to access an ApsaraDB for HBase database.|No|**Note:** This parameter takes effect only in HBase Enhanced Edition. |
|tableName|The name of the ApsaraDB for HBase result table.|Yes|None.|
|columnFamily|The column family name.|Yes|Only the same column family can be inserted.|
|maxRetryTimes|The maximum number of retries for writing data.|No|Default value: 10.**Note:** This parameter is available only in Realtime Compute for Apache Flink V3.2.3 and later. |
|bufferSize|The maximum number of data records that can be stored in the buffer before deduplication is triggered.|No|Default value: 5000.|
|batchSize|The number of data records that are written at a time.|No|Default value: 100.**Note:** We recommend that you set this parameter to a value that ranges from 200 to 300. An excessively large value of batchSize may cause an out-of-memory \(OOM\) error for the task. |
|flushIntervalMs|The interval at which the buffer is cleared to reduce the latency of writing data to ApsaraDB for HBase.|No|Default value: 2000. Unit: milliseconds.|
|writePkValue|Specifies whether to write the primary key value.|No|Default value: false.|
|stringWriteMod|Specifies whether to insert data as the STRING type.|No|Default value: false.|

|haClustserID|The ID of an ApsaraDB for HBase instance in HA mode.|No|This parameter is required only when you access zone-disaster recovery instances.|

## Dynamic table

Some result data of Realtime Compute for Apache Flink is used as a dynamic column based on the value of a column and written into ApsaraDB for HBase. The following example uses the turnover per hour as a dynamic column data in ApsaraDB for HBase.

|rowkey|cf:0|cf:1|cf:2|
|------|----|----|----|
|20170707|100|cf:1|300|

If isDynamicTable is set to true, the table is an ApsaraDB for HBase table that supports dynamic columns.

A dynamic table can contain only three columns, such as ROW\_KEY, COLUMN, and VALUE. Column 2 \(COLUMN in this example\) is a dynamic column. Other parameters in the dynamic table are the same as those in the WITH clause of ApsaraDB for HBase.

**Note:** When a dynamic table is used, all data types must be converted to the STRING type before data is written into ApsaraDB for HBase.

```
CREATE TABLE stream_test_hotline_agent (
  name varchar,
  age varchar,
  birthday varchar,
  primary key (name)
) WITH (
  type = 'cloudhbase',
  ...
  columnFamily = 'cf',
  isDynamicTable ='true'
);
```

**Note:**

-   In the preceding declaration, `birthday` is inserted into the `cf:age` column with ROW\_KEY of `name`. For example, `(wang,18,2016-12-12)` is inserted into the row with ROW\_KEY of `wang` and the `cf:18` column.
-   In the DDL statement, you must declare ROW\_KEY as the primary key and declare the following fields in descending order: ROW\_KEY, COLUMN, and VALUE. In this example, ROW\_KEY is `name`, COLUMN is `age`, and VALUE is `birthday`.

## Sample code

The following sample code demonstrates how to create an ApsaraDB for HBase result table in a Realtime Compute for Apache Flink job:

```
create table source (
  id   TINYINT,
  name BIGINT
) with (
  type = 'random'
);

create table sink (
  id    TINYINT,
  name  BIGINT,
  primary key (id)
) with (
  type = 'cloudhbase',
  zkQuorum = '<yourZkQuorum>',  
  columnFamily = '<yourColumnFamily>',
  tableName = '<yourTableName>'
);

INSERT INTO sink
SELECT id, name FROM source;
```

## FAQ

Q: Why is error `cloudHbase update error, No columns to insert for #10 item` reported when a job for an ApsaraDB for HBase result table is running?

A: The column data \(excluding ROW\_KEY\) of a single record that is written into the ApsaraDB for HBase result table cannot be all null. Before you use Realtime Compute for Apache Flink to write data into the ApsaraDB for HBase result table, filter out all null data.
